### Who am I?

I am a Ph.D. student in Bioinformatics at the University of California, Riverside (UCR).  
My research focuses on computational drug discovery, with a particular emphasis on predicting **synergistic drug combinations** using large-scale transcriptomic and pharmacological datasets.

### What do I do? (briefly)

My projects focus on the integration of multi-omics data and machine learning to advance drug synergy prediction:
1. Building predictive models for drug synergy using **DrugCombDB** and **LINCS L1000** datasets (main).
2. Exploring molecular mechanisms of synergy through drug targets, pathways, and transcriptomic perturbations.
3. Developing scalable pipelines for large-scale **drug pair similarity** and **enrichment analysis**.

More details can be found on the [Projects](#) page.
