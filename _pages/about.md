My name is Tandis, and I'm currently a Bioinformatics grad student at the University of California, Riverside. 

## Interests

I love a mixture of design, computation, and biology in my work, and that's what I'm doing right now. I work on a drug discovery project using computational methods. 

## Hobbies

(Coming soon)
